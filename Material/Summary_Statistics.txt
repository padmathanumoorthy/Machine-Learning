Data Type classification
	|
	|--> Numeric (Quantitative)
	|		|--> Discrete (Counted)
	|		|		|--> Number of mobile phones sold in a month
	|		|
	|		|--> Continuous (Measured)
	|				|--> Speed of a Car
	|				|--> Temperature of a place
	|
	|--> Categorical (Qualitative)
			|--> Ordinal (Ordered)
			|		|--> Feedback from a Customer (1 to 5)
			|
			|--> Nominal (Unordered)
					|--> Country of Residence
					|--> Marital status (Married / Unmarried)

Q1) What is your favorite subject?(Categorical Nominal)
Q2) Gender (Male/Female)? (Categorical Nominal)
Q3) How good are you with Math in a scale of 1 to 10? (Categorical Ordinal)
Q4) What is your score in latest Math exam? (Numeric Discrete)
Q5) In a class, how many have scored between 80 and 90? (Numeric Discrete)

Descriptive Statistics --> Collective summary and describing data
Inferential Statistics --> Make inferences and predictions based on sample data

Q1) Data is available on every customer care interaction. What's the average time it took to respond to a query? (Descriptive)

Q2) I have interviewed 100 prospects for a job. What percent qualified to be selected? (Inferential)

Q3) I caught 100 fishes while fishing. What's the average weight of the fishes which i caught?
(Descriptive)

Q4) I caught 100 fishes while fishing. What's the average weight of the fishes in the lake?
(Inferential)

Q5) 100,00 people have viewed the advertisement. What percent of people have clicked on it?
(Descriptive)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Measures of Center
------------------
Data point --> 9 1 6 11 5 17 14 12 5 3

Mean (Avg)
Sum/number of Data points
83/10 == 8.3

Median
Middle number when the data points are sorted in ascending order
50% of data points are less than Median
50% of data points are more than Median

1 3 5 5 6 9 11 12 14 17
Median == (6 + 9)/2 == 7.5

Mode
Data point that appears maximum number of times
Mode == 5

------------------------------------------------------------

Measures of Spread
How close or apart are the data points.

Variance
Average squared deviations (distance) from each data point to the Mean

Standard Deviation
Square root of the Variance

Mean Absolute deviation
--> Take the absolute value of the distance from the Mean
--> Take the Mean of those distances

Outlier
Data points which are very far from the Mean value of the Data points
Lower outlier 
Higher outlier
